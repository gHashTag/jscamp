Programming teaches us to be so-called realists or a little pesimist. For example, we have requested data, and it's good that they came! What if there is some mistake? Or there is something wrong with the Internet. Either a broken link, some unexpected errors may still occur. It is necessary to somehow know how to somehow work out these errors, take off to work, and for this the “try… catch” construction was invented, which very simply creates requests, if success, then one block is executed, if an error is executed another block.
