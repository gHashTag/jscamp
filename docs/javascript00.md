> “We predict that [serverless](https://www.jscamp.app/en/docs/amplify-01) will grow rapidly. We also predict that on-premises hybrid cloud applications will shrink over time, although some deployments may persist due to regulatory and data governance constraints.

> Serverless computing will become the standard computing paradigm in the cloud age, largely replacing server-side computing and thus ending the client-server era. "

> [Cloud Programming Simplified: A Berkeley View on Serverless Computing](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-3.pdf), February 10, 2019

From this forecast, the demand for serverless technologies is obvious, and therefore for resources teaching these technologies. Therefore, we organized a programming school where we teach serverless technologies AWS Amplify, as well as prepare for them by teaching [English using Emoji](https://www.jscamp.app/docs/blogging-01/), [JavaScript](https://www.jscamp.app/ru/docs/javascript01), [React Native](https://www.jscamp.app/ru/docs/start000) and [TypeScript](https://www.jscamp.app/ru/docs/typescript00).

![javaScript](https://media.giphy.com/media/ln7z2eWriiQAllfVcn/giphy.gif)

For this, we have created a mobile application [JS Camp](http://onelink.to/njhc95), a site [JSCamp.app](https://www.jscamp.app) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR8tIQm7pu8MlPewAlUnzQw), where for training we use 3D avatars available by default in [Amazon Sumerian](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/sumerian/), thanks to which you can easily create exciting 3D -Interfaces. They also integrate with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) services to provide easy access to machine learning, chatbots, code execution and more. With this tool we can create videos, educational materials in popular languages ​​of the world and publish them on [our site](https://www.jscamp.app) and on [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR8tIQm7pu8MlPewAlUnzQw).

## Purpose of the program

Prepare for the course on mobile development in the React Native / TypeScript / AWS Amplify stack and for certification in [AWS Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/en/certification/), where in the process of preparation you will receive a wide range of expertise, resources and programs. We will help you effectively validate your cloud and mobile development expertise that every business needs today.

## JavaScript Camp - JS Camp

To create our [online JavaScript course](https://www.jscamp.app/docs/javascript01), in popular languages ​​of the world, we were inspired by the book [Code for Teens: JavaScript - Jeremy Moritz](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Teens-Beginners-Programming-Javascript-ebook/dp/B07FCTLVPC). The uniqueness of the book is that it is adapted for the study of children by its simplicity of presentation, its only drawback is that the number of topics presented in it is not enough to create real projects. Therefore, we set ourselves the task of creating a book "JavaScript for Kids" with preparation for studying the course on mobile development on the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) library . We have created a course of 29 topics, which even schoolchildren from the age of 10 are now taking. Do you think we have succeeded in solving this problem?

![JavaScript](https://media.giphy.com/media/dC3EHvqJ61hNReoxMV/giphy.gif)

At this point in time, [our mobile app](http://onelink.to/njhc95) implements English and JavaScript tests. To implement this case, we used the [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com) services . You can read more about how we implemented the authentication service [here](https://www.jscamp.app/docs/auth1-01), as well as how we connected the App Sync service [here](https://www.jscamp.app/docs/amplify-03).

## App Sync

[AWS AppSync](https://www.jscamp.app/en/docs/amplify-03) simplifies application development by allowing you to create a universal API for securely accessing, modifying, and merging data from multiple sources. AppSync is a managed service that uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) so that applications can easily retrieve only the data they need.

## GraphQL

It is an API specification, a query language for the API, and a runtime for making those queries with your data. It shares some similarities with REST and is the best replacement for REST. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) was introduced by Facebook in 2015, although it has been used internally since 2012.

![GraphQL](https://fundor333.com/post/2018/graphql-and-working-with-it/graphql-request.gif)

## English by Emoji

Since English is the basis of programming languages, and in Russia, where I come from, it is not my native language, understanding this, we prepared a program for learning English in a playful way using emoji. Emojis have entered our life so much that [films](https://youtu.be/r8pJt4dK_s4) are being made about them . At the moment, the course contains 700 words, which are divided into 12 topics: alphabet, numbers, food and drink, animals, activity, clothes, travel, objects, symbols, time, people, nature. The course is also suitable for those who want to navigate the entire emoji palette well to create emotional social media posts. A video playlist on this topic is available [here](https://www.jscamp.app/docs/blogging-01/).

![Emoji](https://media.giphy.com/media/3EkXc1k1q5kk0/giphy.gif)

## React Native

Who doesn't know [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a library for creating interfaces for iOS and Android, AR / VR and creating websites from Facebook. Do you think we have succeeded in solving this problem? Write to me personally about this in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6GDAfXn). We have created a course of 29 topics, which even schoolchildren from 10 years old are now taking. With React Native, it's a direct road to mobile development. Our course is aimed at those who are completely from scratch and it is better to start with us, as you will save time and you will not need to learn HTML and CSS, getting your hands on sites. With React Native, we typeset UI interfaces on JS objects, so with one knowledge of JavaScript, you can rush with us straight into mobile development.
This course contains the minimum knowledge you need to create mobile applications using the React Native library with AWS Amplify.

## AWS Amplify

[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/en/amplify/) – it is a set of tools and services that can be used together or separately by web and mobile developers to build scalable end-to-end applications on AWS. With Amplify, you can configure application backends and connect applications in minutes, deploy static web applications with a few clicks, and easily manage application content outside of the AWS console.
Amplify supports popular web platforms like JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, and mobile platforms like Android, iOS, React Native, Ionic, Flutter (preview). Fast time to market with AWS Amplify.

## TypeScript

JavaScript was originally created to make web pages live. Due to its ease of use, it gained popularity and began to be used on almost all platforms. JavaScript code is built on scripts, which are supposed to be small and fast. The developers didn't think that JavaScript would be used to write applications with a lot of code. In this connection, large applications written in JavaScript have problems. Here is some of them:

1. Due to the interpretability of the language, you can find out about the error only after executing the code;
2. The complexity of using the practices of object-oriented programming;
3. Dynamic typing.

To solve such problems, the TypeScript programming language was created.

![TypeScript](https://serokell.io/files/0u/0ufu1q21.js-ts.jpg)

TypeScript is a programming language introduced by Microsoft in 2012 and marketed as a web application development tool that extends JavaScript. TypeScript is backward compatible with JavaScript and compiles to the latter. In fact, once compiled, a TypeScript program can be executed in any modern browser or shared with the Node.js server framework. TypeScript code looks almost the same as JS code and if you have experience in frontend development, learning TypeScript is quite simple. Especially considering that you can write JS code directly in TS scripts. So we decided to [teach](https://www.jscamp.app/ru/docs/typescript00) him in our JS Camp it-camp.

## Music album

The JS course consists of articles, video tutorials, podcasts, and music tracks. We created the first ever JavaScript music album. Which is available now at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/serverlesskiy/sets/javascript) in Russian. I invite you to perform it in your own language.

## Badges

In the last update of our application, a user loyalty system was released. Now everyone who has passed the English, JavaScript, ReactNative, TypeScript, AWS Amplify exams receive the corresponding badges in our JS Camp application, which can be downloaded for free for iOS and Android [here](http://onelink.to/njhc95). True, tests are still available only in English and JavaScript, but this year they will be on all topics.

## Open Source

Our project is available [Open Source](https://github.com/fullstackserverless/Sumerian), so you can also participate in its development. We call for the translation of [the site](https://github.com/gHashTag/jscamp) into languages other than English, Russian and Chinese, so everyone can contribute to it.
