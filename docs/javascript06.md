In JavaScript, any text data is strings. However, do not forget that numbers can also be written in a string. Of all the data types, you will probably use strings the most. Let's analyze all the options for creating a new line.

## Single or double quotes

![quotation marks](https://media.giphy.com/media/7cSTvZ4hI6ABZkcTwk/giphy.gif)

Either ‚Äòsingle‚Äô or ‚Äúdouble‚Äù quotes are used to create strings.

```jsx
let single = 'Hello World'
let double = "Hello World" // prettier-ignore
```

You can use both of them, the main thing is that if you start a line with a single one, although there may be doubles inside, it must also be completed with a single one. And, accordingly, with double quotes.

```jsx
let double = "Don't you think so, d'Artagnan?"
let single = '"I think so, indeed!" - cried he.'
```

## Backslash

![shielding](https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IPizf4zPR6VMt2/giphy.gif)

If the same quotes are used inside the string as outside, then they must be escaped with a backslash - the so-called "escape character". It is appended ‚ûï before the enclosing quotation mark `\ '' so that it does not indicate the end of the line.

```jsx live
// prettier-ignore
function learnJavaScript() {
  let backticks = 'It\'s not complicated'
  return backticks
}
```

Note that the backslash `\` is only used to correctly read the string by the interpreter, but it is not written  to the string after it has been read. When a string is saved to main memory, the `\` character is not added to it. You can clearly see this in the findings.

## Back quotes

![Dollar](https://media.giphy.com/media/26BoCwvDEWXnGlLyM/giphy.gif)

In writing a string, you can do without a backslash by using \ `back \` quotes.

Single and double quotes work essentially the same way, and if you use back quotes, we can insert arbitrary JavaScript expressions into such a string by wrapping them in a dollar sign with curly braces `$ {...}` :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  const sum = (a, b) => a + b // this is a function, we'll get to know it later in the course
  return `1 + 2 = ${sum(1, 2)}`
}
```

Another advantage of backticks is that they can span more than one line.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let guestList = `Guests:
    * John
    * Pete
    * Mary
   `
  return guestList
}
```

Multiline strings can also be created with single and double quotation marks, using the so-called "line feed" character, which is written as `\ n`. All special characters, in JavaScript, begin with a backslash `\` True, we can check this in the browser console (`LIVE EDITOR` does not display correctly).

```jsx
let guestList = 'Guests:\n * John\n * Pete\n * Mary'

guestList // multi-line guest list
```

## Strings are immutable

![Tree](https://media.giphy.com/media/YxlUxrYGw2w9y/giphy.gif)

The content of a string in JavaScript cannot be changed. You cannot take the symbol in the middle and replace it. Once a string is created - it is like that forever.
You can create a new string and write it to the same variable instead of the old one.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = 'Hi'
  str = 'P' + str[1] // replace string
  return str
}
```

## Popular string methods

### String length

![Length](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y1GK5MEiRa3OSVsxHK/giphy.gif)

The `length` property returns the number of code values in the string.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = 'My\n'.length
  return str
}
```

Please note that `\ n` is one special character, so everything is correct here: the length of the string is 3.

### Access to symbols

![Door](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aLpVxPVEoEPXji/giphy.gif)

There are two 2Ô∏è‚É£ ways to get to a specific character in a string. The first method uses the `charAt ()` method. The first 1Ô∏è‚É£ character is at position zero:

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = 'cat'.charAt(2)
  return str
}
```

You can also get a symbol using square brackets:

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = 'cat'[2]
  return str
}
```

Square brackets are the modern way to get a character, while `charAt` exists mainly for historical reasons.

### Change case of characters

![Capital letter](https://media.giphy.com/media/3orifcBbnezczHmU8g/giphy.gif)

To convert the letters of a string to uppercase, use the `toUpperCase ()` method.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = 'Interface'.toUpperCase()
  return str
}
```

to lowercase `toLowerCase ()`

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = 'Interface'.toLowerCase()
  return str
}
```

### Concatenate (concatenate) a string

![Chain](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2EOu4nu1D8uJKU/giphy.gif)

To construct a string from existing strings, use the plus sign `+` to concatenate the strings.

```jsx
let name = 'Mary '
let activity = 'drink tea'
let bio = 'Our guest ' + name + activity + '.'
bio // Our guest Mary drink tea.
```

<!-- –¢–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ–±—É–π—Ç–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—å —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∫—É —Å–∞–º–∏.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let name = 'John'
  let age = '15'
  let country = 'USA'
  let enjoyment = 'trevel'
  let slogan = '"Don\'t worry, be happy!"'
  let bio =
    'My name is ' +
    name +
    '. I am ' +
    age +
    " years old. I'm from " +
    country +
    '. I like ' +
    enjoyment +
    ', and my slogan for life: ' +
    slogan +
    '.'
  bio
  return bio
}
```

–ò `+=` for assignment with union.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let str = '123'
  str += 456
  return str
}
``` -->

So we got acquainted with the most popular data type in JavaScript and the most commonly used methods for it.
