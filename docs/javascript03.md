## Variables

Variables  (Variables, abbreviated as `var`) are a container, for values such as numbers used in addition ‚ûï, or a string that we could use as part of a sentence, and other data types that we'll get to know later.

## Variable declaration

![Announcement](https://media.giphy.com/media/cYaBD8kxE4PZudHBRA/giphy.gif)

To use a variable, you must first create it, or, more precisely, declare a variable. To do this, we introduce the keyword `var` followed by the name you want to give your variable. The instruction below creates (in other words: declares or defines) a variable named "message":

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  var message = ''

  return message
}
```

Here we create a variable  `message`. Currently ‚è±Ô∏è it does not contain a value, to be more precise, the variable contains an empty string.

## Assigning a value to a variable

![Memory](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZtafpgSpvIaKhMI/giphy.gif)

Once the variable  is declared, it can be assigned a value. To do this, write  variable name , followed by an equal sign `=`, followed by the value you want to assign. For example :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  var message
  message = 'My name is ...'
  // We can access it using the variable name
  return message
}
```

In `RESULT`, the value that you assigned to the variable  returned in the console. Play around üéÆ with the values of a variable , for example, complete the expression with your name.

For brevity, you can combine the declaration of a variable  and writing  in one line :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  var message = 'Hello!' // define a variable and assign a value to it
  return message
}
```

## Variable update

![Update](https://media.giphy.com/media/FP47IFqWyXfdKYU6VG/giphy.gif)

One of the peculiarities of variables  is that their meaning can change.
When a value is assigned to a variable , you can change (update) that value simply by specifying a different value. Let's take a look at a simple example :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  var message = 'Bob' // now message Bob
  message = true // and now the message is true
  message = 35 // and as a result message 35

  return message
}
```

Another feature of variables  is that they can contain almost anything, not just strings and numbers. Variables  can also contain complex data and even entire functions. You will learn more about this as you study the course further.

::: tip Note!
We say that variables contain values. This is an important distinction. Variables are not the values themselves! They are containers for values. Imagine that they are like little cardboard boxes in which you can store things.

## Variable naming rules

![Rules](https://media.giphy.com/media/XK8I8Am1gSe17MiJ2m/giphy.gif)

You can name the variable  whatever you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should only stick to Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.

- The use of other symbols is not recommended because they may cause errors or be incomprehensible to an international audience.
- Do not use underscores at the beginning of variable names  - this is used in some JavaScript constructs to denote specific things.
- Do not use numbers at the beginning of variables . This is invalid and will result in an error.
- It is generally accepted to stick to the so-called "lower camel case" (camelCase - so called because of the "humps" that form the first letters of words), where you glue several words, using lowercase letters for the entire first word, and then capital letters of subsequent words. We have used this for our variable names  in this article.
- Make variable names  intuitive about what data they contain. Do not use only single letters / numbers or large long phrases.
- Variables  are case sensitive, so `myage` and` myAge` are different variables .
- Last but not least - you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as variable names  - by that we mean the words that make up the actual JavaScript syntax! Thus, you cannot use words like var, function, let, and for for variable names . Browsers recognize them as different pieces of code and therefore errors occur.

## List of reserved words

![Reserved](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mb3eci7bVDKBR2o/giphy.gif)

We cannot call variables  with these words, since they are reserved in the JavaScript language.
`break`, `case`, `catch`, `class`, `const`, `continue`, `debugger`, `default`, `delete`, `do`, `else`, `export`, `extends`, `finally`, `for`, `function`, `if`, `import`, `in`, `instanceof`, `new`, `return`, `super`, `switch`, `this`, `throw`, `try`, `typeof`, `var`, `void`, `while`, `with`, `yield`

## Loose typing

![Freedom](https://media.giphy.com/media/6901DbEbbm4o0/giphy.gif)

JavaScript is a ‚Äúfreely typed language ‚Äù which means that unlike some other languages  you do not need to specify what type of data the variable will contain (eg numbers, strings, arrays, etc.).

For example, if you declare a variable  and assign a quoted value to it, the browser will treat the variable  as a string :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  var myString = 'Hello'
  // It will still be a string, even if it contains numbers, so be careful:
  var myNumber = '500' // oops, it's still a string

  myNumber = 500 // that's better, now it's number. Remove this line and look at the data type.

  return typeof myNumber
}
```

## Deprecated "var" keyword

![Old](https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieJI3IdkKWIsAGA/giphy.gif)

Usually `var` is not used in modern scripts, but it can still be hidden in old ones. This is due to the fact that it does not behave unambiguously, so instead of `var` we will use `let` for variables , and `const` for constants - constants.

 The break is over, let's run to the next lesson!
