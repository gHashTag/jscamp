## Clothes

Every day we are faced with the choice of clothes 👕 🤔 👔 when going to school / work in the morning or buying it in the store / internet.

There is a huge variety of clothes:
💫 everyday - festive;
💫 adult - children;
💫 winter-summer;
💫sports home.

Therefore, it is so important to know the name of the wardrobe items that we use so often in our lives.

👩🏾 And the animated English teacher Chris Brown will help you with this.

## Smileys

We often do not have enough words to express our emotions through correspondence, where we cannot catch the change in these emotions.
In this case, animated emotions come to the rescue - smilies 😃, which help to significantly reduce the volume of the message, just replacing the text with the icon ☺

Smilies 🙃 are quite necessary at the current level of development of social networks, because many people spend a significant amount of time there.

And in the JS Camp mobile app 🦄 you can learn the entire palette of 😄 😂 😍 🥳 🤑 emoticons in English.

## Time

Every day we are faced with the concept of time 🕧: when we make an appointment with someone, make an appointment with a doctor, or just prompt a passerby on the street.
When learning English, you need to know how to specify the exact time of day.
