The Rubik's Cube is a kind of mechanical puzzle that has gained particular popularity on a global scale. This toy was bought and continues to be bought, which is simply amazing. She was named after her creator. The cube is popular not only among children. The adult generation is also extremely interested in him, especially those individuals who have not solved his riddle.

A distinctive feature of this toy is that it brings not only joy and pleasure from the process, but also a lot of benefits. The positive aspects include the development of memory, fine motor skills of hands, logic and spatial imagination. He also forms perseverance in children and teaches them to strive for the set goal. Among other things, this hobby may well grow from the category of entertainment into the work of a lifetime.

Rubik's cube is used to call it simply "Rubik's cube", but this is wrong. Its name comes from the name of the creator.
Erne Rubik is the author of the puzzle. He received a patent for an invention in 1975, a year after he invented it. Rubik was not a mathematician or a scientist. He was engaged in sculpture, taught students the basics of architecture at a Hungarian university.

In the 1970s, the inventor of the puzzle taught his subject at the University of Budapest. The students had difficulties with the assimilation of the material, so the professor decided to convey the information in a more convenient way, to simplify the perception by visualization.

The benefits of puzzle toys are obvious. They teach children to find a way out of the most impasse situations, so the Rubik's cube should take an honorable place among other things that can provide high-quality leisure, especially since its cost will not be significant and you can learn it in our school for only $ 9

## Introduction

In order to get into the JavaScript class, you need to collect the Rubik's cube. For those who still do not know how to solve the cube, we teach according to the author's method #yogaCubicaRubica

## yogaCubicRubica

#yogaCubeRubica - this is how we called the lesson on solving the Rubik's cube, having developed in our school of antiquity a simple diagram of chakras of 6 algorithms to prepare your mind for the logic and spatial thinking, which is so necessary in programming.

## Assembly diagram

1. MULADHARA - cube position edge

1) Collect 4 white petals around the yellow core
2) Align with the color of the side, throwing it over the white cross
3) Assemble the white base, aligning the corner at the top right and the colors along the core.

2. SVADHISHTHANA - rib position

1) Collect the side two bottom rows
2) Do not touch yellow

3. MANIPURA - face position

1) Collect the yellow cross based on the yellow strip

4. ANAHATA - rib position

1) Align the cores with the yellow cross, starting with only one aligned core

5. VISHUDDHA - position face

1) Align one side petal with mulodhara and align the corner lobes with the sides

![pullreqest](/img/blogging/00/5me.png)

6. AJNA

1) Aim the yellow side at yourself
2) From any upper right corner, we do the algorithm until the match
3) Flip another corner to the same corner

## Studying time

In 6 days, you will not only memorize all 6 algorithms, but also the Sanskrit chakra system, consolidating knowledge by the speed of assembly.

## Competition

🏅 Once a month @javaScriptCamp hosts an online #speedCubing competition with a prize pool!
If you also want to become a participant in the competition, then we are happy to welcome you to our school - perhaps you will become the winner!

To register for the competition and support in training, please contact [discort chat](https://discord.gg/UPSeqZJT)

## Rotation language

The language of rotation of the Rubik's cube according to Jessica Friedrich's method looks like this:

R - move right side clockwise
R'- movement with the right side counterclockwise

U - movement of the upper side clockwise
U'- movement of the upper side counterclockwise

F - movement by the frontal side clockwise
F'- movement of the frotal side counterclockwise

L - move left side clockwise
L'- movement left side counterclockwise

D - movement of the bottom side clockwise
D'- movement of the lower side counterclockwise

B - backward movement clockwise
B'- backward movement counterclockwise

M - movement of the middle vertical side clockwise
M'- movement of the middle vertical side counterclockwise

## Scrambl

Before collecting the cube, we need to disassemble it. For this, special formulas are used, which are called Scrambl.
Here is one of them:

R2 F R’ F’ D2 R2 U F U’ B L2 F2 R F2 U’ L F2 L B R’ D’ L’ D’ R F
