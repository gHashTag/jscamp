To get started with TypeScript, you need to install its toolkit. You can install TypeScript through the NPM package manager.

## Installing Node.js

To install via NPM, you need to have Node.js installed (if not already installed). For further actions, you need an installed package manager [Chocolatey](https://react-native-village.github.io/docs/start00#установка-chocolatey). Install NPM with it.
To start the installation process, you need to run the command in Powershell:

```bash
choco install -y nodejs.install
```

## Installing TypeScript

To install TypeScript you need to execute the command in Powershell:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

After the installation is complete, PowerShell will give you this output:

It is possible that TS has already been installed previously. In this case, it can be updated to the latest version using the command

```bash
npm update -g typescript
```

To check the TypeScript version, enter the command

```bash
tsc -v
```
