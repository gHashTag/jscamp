## What are comments?

JavaScript has several ways to specify comments in code 

Sometimes, when writing  the code, you will need to provide explanations that are intended only for humans а and not for the computer. Perhaps it will be some kind of message to yourself from the past (to the Future Me!) About this or that thing in the program code. Or maybe it will just be an indication that you need to run only such and such a part of the code, and the rest should be omitted. In short, in any such case, you will need to resort to the help of comments.
Comments  are used to add ➕ hints, notes , suggestions or warnings. They can make the code easier to read and understand. They can also be used to prevent  code execution (this is a common practice when debugging code).

JavaScript has several ways to specify comments  in code.

## Single line comment

The first 1️⃣ way is `// comment`  in this case all text  in the line after the double slash will be a comment . When the interpreter sees two 2️⃣ slashes in a row `//`, it immediately understands that everything that goes further to the end of the line can be safely ignored. For now, ignore the syntax    of the code, we will get to know it in detail a little later.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  // This is a comment on the line
  var hello = 'Hello world!!!'

  return hello
}
```

## Multi-line comment

The second 2️⃣ way is `/ * * /`, which is more flexible than the first 1️⃣. As soon as the interpreter sees `/ *`, it thinks: "Yeah, so until I see`* /`, I can not pay any attention to anything here!"
For example, you can use it in one 1️⃣ line :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  /* This is a one-line comment */
  var hello = 'Hello world!!!'

  return hello
}
```

Alternatively, you can make a multi-line comment  as shown here :

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  /* This comment spans multiple lines.
      Please note that you do not need to terminate the comment until you have finished */
  var hello = 'Hello world!!!'
  /* Write your comment here */
  return hello
}
```

## Comment in the middle of the code

Also, if you wish, you can use this commenting  in the middle of a line of code. Although this may impair the readability of the code:

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  var x = ''
  var hello = 'Hello ' + x /* insert the value x */ + '!'

  return hello
}
```

With the commenting on the code, that's all and the call for a break sounded.
