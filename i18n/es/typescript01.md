To get started with TypeScript, you need to install its toolkit. You can install TypeScript through the NPM package manager.

## Installing Node.js

To install via NPM, you need to have Node.js installed (if not already installed). For further actions, you need an installed package manager [Chocolatey](https://react-native-village.github.io/docs/start00#—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞-chocolatey). Install NPM with it.
To start the installation process, you need to run the command in Powershell:

```bash
choco install -y nodejs.install
```

## Installing TypeScript

To install TypeScript you need to execute the command in Powershell:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

After the installation is complete, PowerShell will give you this output:
![install_success](/img/typescript/01/install.png)

It is possible that TS has already been installed previously. In this case, it can be updated to the latest version using the command

```bash
npm update -g typescript
```

To check the TypeScript version, enter the command

```bash
tsc -v
```

## Initializing TypeScript in a project

All that remains to be done is to connect TypeScript to your project. To do this, you need to create a file with the extension `.ts` in the project folder, write the code and compile it.
This can be done in PowerShell with the command:

```bash
tsc
```

For example:

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

:::note Note
First you need to move to the project folder. Otherwise, the file will not be found. On the command line, moving through folders is done with the command `cd`.
:::
The compiler will create a file with the extension `.js`. Compilation is required after each change.

It's that easy to work with TypeScript.
