If you are building a digital startup, then most likely you have in your team:

- iOS developer  ,
- Android developer ,
- Backend developer  ,
- Site developer      and
- Teamlead     , who at least superficially understands a little bit everywhere, but in some respects perfectly well - these are 5 people.

Nowadays, thanks to the AWS Amplify platform and in particular Amazon's DataStore, you can replace 5 developers with one full stack serverless developer.

We provide an opportunity to find such a full stack serverless developer for only 99 üí≤ using our mobile application

## Why us?

Because we are the creators of the first course on React Native and AWS Amplify in runet. We learn this technology and we personally know successful students with whom we create our open source mobile application.

## Video is recommended for viewing!

# The main tasks of the mobile application:

## 1. Solve problems

Developers can describe their problems they face in the process of developing mobile applications in react-native and get expert help on them.

## 2. Motivate to solve problems

For successfully provided technical support, the developer is issued a unicorn, from the number of which a rating of programmers is formed, which in turn increases their chance of getting a more attractive offer from employers.

## 3. To find employment

In the application, you can create a resume, apply for a vacancy and receive an offer from an employer.

## 4. Teach React Native + GraphQL + AWS Amplify Technology Stack

Based on the code written for this application, and released in Open Source, a Full Stack Serverless tutorial is created in the React Native + AWS Amplify + GraphQL stack. At the moment, it is the most progressive technology stack that allows creating secure mobile applications many times faster.

# Workflow

There is enough practice for any level, from component layout to custom hooks.
The work is carried out according to the Kanban development management method, the board is available [here](https://github.com/react-native-village/aws-amplify-react-hooks/projects/1).

## –óTasks are divided into three types of difficulty:

- UI - layout and component creation

- Screens & Navigation - composition of screens from UI components

- Logic - business logic of the application

Choose a task for yourself from the backlog column and coordinate it with me in [chat](https://teleg.run/reactnativeunicorn) work on the application or suggest your problem

‚öõÔ∏è On the roadmap and in general, I am always open to suggestions.

I invite volunteers to create it.

We love Open Source and believe that the future belongs to it, if you are not indifferent to the development of the community and are ready to contribute, then!
