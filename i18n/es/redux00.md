We continue and begin our new course on the topic - managing the state of a mobile application with the Redux library in React Native applications. In this course, we will develop with you a mobile application that will search the database, on the server for movies. This course builds on the previous courses, but if you are not a beginner and also familiar with react navigation, then you can start with this course.
