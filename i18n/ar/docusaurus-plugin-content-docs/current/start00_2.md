This article will help you set up the React Native working environment on the macOS operating system for the iOS mobile operating system.

## Components

To work, you need the following components: Node, Watchman, XCode, and the React Native CLI.

You need an editor to create program code. We recommend using `VS Code` But you can use any other editor you like.

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - a command line utility in macOS and Linux that allows you to install packages and applications. In short, `Homebrew` is a package manager for macOS.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

## Node.js & Watchman & CocoaPods

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - is a `JavaScript` server-side development environment. If you've installed `Node` before, make sure it is version 10 or higher.

```bash
brew install node
```

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) - An open source file viewer that monitors files and takes action when they change. Install it to improve performance.

```bash
brew install watchman
```

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) - it is a powerful yet elegant tool for managing the dependencies of Cocoa libraries that developers use in their iOS and MacOS projects.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## XCode

`XCode` - is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS software developed by Apple. The easiest way to install `XCode` - through [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Inside `Xcode`, you need to install the desired` iOS` simulator and command line tools.

#### iOS Simulator

The simulator is installed in the Xcode settings, in order to enter the application settings in the top panel, select `Xcode`, then` Preferences ... `

A window with settings will open. To install the simulator, go to the `Components` tab. The list of available simulators opens, choosing the one you like, install it by clicking on the arrow next to the simulator name.

#### Command line tools

To configure the tools, go to the `Locations` tab in the` Xcode` settings. The line `Command Line Tools:` in the drop-down list select the most recent version of the command line tools.

## Creating a ReactNative project

Creating a project and further working with a project in React Native is similar to creating a project in Windows 10. The built-in command line interface React Native `npx` is used to create a project. Let's create a project called `MyReact`. After starting the command in the terminal, the process of creating a project will go, it is not quick.

```bash
npx react-native init MyReact
```

## Metro Bundler launch

`Metro Bundler` is a` JavaScript` builder that comes with `React Native`. Metro accepts files and input parameters, compiling all JavaScript files into one file. After its launch, we can see in which file `Metro` has compiled the` JavaScript` code, it is highlighted in green.

The launch is carried out in the terminal, before starting the command, go to the directory with our project `MyReact` and write the following command:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

If no errors were found at startup, we will see the following picture:
![XCode](/img/rn/00_2/04_01.png)

## Application launch

Do not turn off the terminal where Metro Bundler is running. To launch the application, open a new terminal. This step also requires you to go to the root of the `MyReact` project. After the transition, execute the command:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

This command will launch the application of the project `MyReact` in the simulator` iOS`. If you haven't changed any files in the project, you should see a greeting from `React Native`.

## VS Code

As mentioned at the beginning of this article, any editor will work, but we recommend using `VS Code`. To install the recommended editor, you can use the previously specified `Homebrew` package manager, for this you need to write the following command in the terminal:

```bash
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

After installing `VS Code`, launch it. To open the project `MyReact` in the main menu we find the line` Open folder ... `, by clicking on which a dialog box will open, in which you need to select the folder with our project` MyReact`.

After selecting a project, the Navigator navigation panel will appear for working with the project.

## Hello World

After we have installed and launched `VS Code`, we can start working. To do this, open the file `App.js` in the root of the project. This file describes what the user will see when the application starts. On first launch, we saw a greeting from `React Native`. We can change several lines and when saving, the picture on the simulator will change. Replace all the code in the `App.js` file with the one below and save the file:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Text style={styles.h1}>Hello World</Text>
    </>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  h1: {
    backgroundColor: '#BEFCE5',
    color: '#000',
    fontSize: 25,
    fontWeight: '700',
    padding: 20,
    textAlign: 'center'
  }
})

export default App
```
