AWS Amplify is a platform for developing robust and scalable mobile and web applications. This platform greatly simplifies tasks such as authenticating users, storing user data and metadata securely, selectively granting access to data, integrating machine learning, analyzing application metrics, and executing server-side code. Amplify covers the entire mobile app development workflow, from version control and code testing to production deployment, and scales easily as your business grows, allowing you to grow your user base from thousands to tens of millions. The open source Amplify libraries and command line interface are part of the Amplify platform. In a plugin, you can customize and create your own plugins.

# Amplify benefits

## Enormous breadth and depth

Amplify takes advantage of the AWS cloud to build applications, so you get access to significantly more services and functionality in many of these services than other mobile application development platforms. When the number of users of your application grows significantly, there is no need to move to an industrial-grade platform as Amplify scales as your business grows. In Amplify, you can build on-demand applications that can handle millions of requests per second and hundreds of terabytes of data around the world with latency of about one microsecond.

## Development for any platform

Amplify is a comprehensive solution for developing and launching mobile applications for Android and iOS systems on this platform, as well as on the web development platforms React Native, React, Ionic, Angular, JavaScript and Vue. This platform has everything you need for version control, automated code testing, and production deployment of your application. For rapidly growing web applications, Amplify is the only platform that integrates front-end and back-end development workflows.

## Simplified data handling

In Amplify, the data access process runs flawlessly, there is no difficulty in setting up technologies to work with multiple databases. You can easily integrate existing data sources, such as various relational and non-relational databases. Amplify allows you to use GraphQL to simplify data management, whereas other platforms do not. GraphQL allows you to accelerate the development of mobile applications and make them more interactive by being able to query and retrieve pieces of information from different sources in a single network request. This saves CPU and battery resources used by the application.

## Offline sync

Amplify provides data storage on the device with the function of synchronization with the data stored on the server. All other platforms only provide caching of data on the device. While the device is offline, the application can query and write data locally thanks to Amplify. Once the device is back online, Amplify will automatically sync the local data with the data stored on the server and resolve any conflicts. With Amplify, you can build robust mobile apps that can withstand network disruptions, as well as real-time collaboration apps across multiple devices.

## No server management

Amplify lets you execute code that implements the functionality of your application on the server side without having to manage the servers. You optimize costs because you pay only for the resources you use, and you don't have to worry about maintaining servers, installing updates or backing up, and apps are automatically highly available.

## Effective security controls

Amplify provides much more powerful security controls than other platforms. In Amplify, you can configure specific access controls for each user of your application. You can easily set up combined authentication with Amazon, Facebook, and Google, and control access to specific data that specific users have access to.

# Opportunities

Amplify provides capabilities such as Authentication, Analytics, APIs (GraphQL and REST), Interactions, Prediction, PubSub, Data Warehousing, Push Notifications, and XR that can be used to build advanced serverless applications based on AWS services.

## Data storage

Persistent storage of data on the device with the ability to send queries and synchronize data between the application and the cloud using GraphQL.

## Authentication

Adding user registration and authorization capabilities to mobile and Internet applications, as well as full access control.

## Analytics

Analytics support for tracking user sessions, attributes, and in-app metrics.

## API

Create HTTP requests quickly and securely using REST and GraphQL.

## Augmented and virtual reality

Easy integration of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and 3D scenes.

## Interactions

Creation of voice and text dialogue interfaces based on deep learning technologies.

## Notifications

Integration of personalized push notifications with built-in analytics and targeting.

## Forecasting

Adding AI / ML capabilities to the application through the use of cloud services.

## PubSub

Connecting the application to cloud message middleware.

## Vault

Manage user-generated content securely in the cloud and on the device.
