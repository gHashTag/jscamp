Each profession has its own vocabulary, both React programmers have their own, and React Native programmers have their own, so it would be nice to know words from all the official documentation, to be able to read it, since you will constantly work with it in writing and without knowing words from of this library, it becomes difficult to understand what they are talking and writing about in general, so I took all the words from the React and React Native libraries, copied them, refactored them, created a partial dictionary based on them and created [course](https://www.memrise.com/course/1450006/react-react-native/), which consists of 2229 words.
