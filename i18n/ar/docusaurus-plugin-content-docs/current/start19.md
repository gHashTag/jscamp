If you conceptually understand this issue and in a simple way, then functional components are mainly used in rendering your UI Kit, that is, these are forms, buttons, titles, inputs, and this is more about design. Class Components have their own states, requests to the server go in them, and they wrap smart and stupid components in themselves, these are, as it were, such components as parents, they have their own state.
