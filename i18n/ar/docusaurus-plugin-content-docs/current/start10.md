import YouTube from 'react-youtube'


For a clear understanding of how everything works under the hood, we will take from our application, copy the JSX syntax, the view where the text field is wrapped. Next, open the Babel website — [http://babeljs.io](http://babeljs.io) click “Try it out” and paste it into the first field and see the result with a large code on the right. Agree, the left side looks much more elegant, so no one writes like on the right and I do not recommend it to you. It is a Facebook invention that allows HTML developers with a rich background to make the transition to a component-based approach easier. For me, this syntax became familiar, that while preparing this lesson, I even forgot that once people programmed differently.
