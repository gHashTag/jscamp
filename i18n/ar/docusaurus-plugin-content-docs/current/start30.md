If we look at our application and run it on the iPhone 5 or under Android, we will see that our header is very large, not pretty, and we need to do something about it, and for this we use SafeAreaView. SafeAreaView is a component from the React Native API that is used for iPhone X and we understand that we need to make an application for this target audience and it is important to style our applications using this component.
