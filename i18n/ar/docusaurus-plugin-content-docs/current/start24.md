Dimensions is a component, more precisely, it is the React Native API that we need to determine the screen size. Since Android has its own sizes, iOS has its own sizes, then we need to somehow tie to the width and height for cross-platform layout. For this, the native Dimensions API comes to our aid. In order to connect it, you need to refer to its Get Window method and get the height and width of the screen and that's it.
