Plugin ES Lint — [https://eslint.org](https://eslint.org) allows you to write your code cleaner, tells you where you make mistakes and, in general, it is a good practice for working in a team, so that everyone has everything in the same style - ES Lint will suggest which variables you do not use, where and which components do not use, shows syntax errors and where you put spaces incorrectly, where you put semicolons, etc. That is, this is already a de facto standard that must be used in writing your code, and this plugin will save you from many stupid mistakes that you make when developing your application.

Prettier - Code formatting tool with support for multiple languages, minimum configuration and maximum imposed rules.
